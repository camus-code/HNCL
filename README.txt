HNCL
====

Hacker News in Common Lisp

HNCL is a clone of Hacker News written in Common Lisp. Heavy use of
Clamp (https://github.com/malisper/Clamp) is used to assist with the
translation from Arc to Common Lisp.

There are two reasons why I started this project. The first one is to
get a better understanding of how HN works, as well as web development
in general. The second is similar to the reason I created Clamp. To
provide a version of HN written in a non-toy language.
